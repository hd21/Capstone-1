Introduction
------------
The "My Fitness Finder" web app displays exercise videos and fitness events according to the user's preference for an exercise type. The aim of this web app is to help users explore and try different exercises either at home with instructional YouTube videos or at Meetup events with their local community. What's unique about this app is its easy accessibility - videos and event information are presented all in one page.

Technology
----------
The following front-end technologies were used:

 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery

In addition, the web app uses Font Awesome, Bootstrap and Lity. The latter two allow the page to be responsive, usable and adjustable on devices with small and large screens.  

The main sources of data were the YouTube and Meetup APIs. jQuery (AJAX calls) would request and load data from the respective APIs once events (e.g. click events) were detected by event handlers. The data would then be appended to the DOM in specific, organized design.
